## Developing

Run these scripts to watch code, and recompile sass when changes are made.

```none
npm run watch:code
npm run watch:css
```

## Learning

I wrote this small project to see how well i could follow a clients instructions, and deliver a working prototype.

One main goal i had when setting out was to learn the basics of [gsap](https://greensock.com/gsap/). Also along my way i discovered a great way of implementing an "event dispatcher" system, similar to nodes event emitter, read about that [here](https://javascript.info/dispatch-events).
